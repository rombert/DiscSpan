DiscSpan

author:  ceedvd ( a t )  g  m a i l .com

---------

This tool is geared more towards smaller files such as music and photos 
as it cannot span a single file across multiple discs.  

If you have lots of files in the gigabyte  range, this utility won't be as efficient.

The tool is written in Python and uses growisofs as the burning interface.


Requirements
------------

It is known to work in Fedora 8, but should work on any recent 
Linux system with growisofs, and python 2.5.  Requires the dbus-python module.


running and installing DiscSpan
----------------

copy the discscan.py somewhere in your path.
run discspan.py.

You will be prompted for the directory you'd like to backup, the device
you want to use to burn, and the speed at which you will burn.

The program will then analyze the files and calculate how many DVDs are
needed as well as make sure no files are greater than the size of a DVD
itself.

If you run discspany.py with the "test" argument, it will perform a test
burn.


limitations
-----------

DBUS doesn't detect the capacity of the disc properly so I can't modify
these on the fly.  If someone can give me the capacity in bytes of a Dual Layer
DVD or Blue Ray/HD-DVD, I can add that.

I've guestimated values but if they are wrong, please tweek them and send
me an appropriate update.

Also, this has only been tested on dvd-r and dvd-rw media.


todo
-----

Optionally provide command-line arugments.
Advanced file sorting to optimally use the space on the DVD.


Thank Yous
-----------
Thank you to Davyd Madeley and Dieter Verfaillie for their DBUS
code examples!  Without that, I would not have figured out
how to detect the DVD drive :).

Also thanks to the #python channel on freenode.  Wonderful folks.
